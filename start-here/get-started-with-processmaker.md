{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Analyze Documents in a \"Loan Application\" Process" %}
See how ProcessMaker integrates with third-party services Amazon Textract and UiPath Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) so a loan application workflow scans, analyzes, and intelligently routes a [Request](../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) and provision a bot accordingly.

* **Intended audience:** Process designers and business analysts

{% tab title="Call Third-Party APIs with Data Connectors" %}
### Example 1

See how [ProcessMaker Data Connectors](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) call third-party Application Program Interfaces \(APIs\), and then use that data in [Processes](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md).

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, business analysts, software developers, coding engineers
* **Viewing time:** 9 minutes; contains narration

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/393099655" %}

### Example 2

This example demonstrates dependent fields: how the options in one [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control depend on which option is selected from a previous Select List control. This example demonstrates how a Select List control in a [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) can display the names of major universities around the world as its options in a drop-down menu. The options in this Select List control come from a [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) that calls a third-party Application Program Interface \(API\) when the ProcessMaker Screen containing the Select List control opens.

See how to populate a [Record List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/record-list-control-settings.md) control from records in a [ProcessMaker Collection](../collections/what-is-a-collection.md).

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, Web designers, graphic designers, software developers, coding engineers
* **Viewing time:** 10 minutes; contains narration

{% tab title="Design Dependent Fields" %}
### Example 1

This example demonstrates dependent fields: how the options in one [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control depend on which option is selected from a previous Select List control. This example demonstrates that after a country is selected from one Select List control, a second Select List control contains as options the states and/or provinces in that selected country.

The Select List control that contains the countries as its options gets those options from a [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) that uses an [Endpoint](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-an-endpoint.md) to get the list of countries and their corresponding ISO codes from a third-party application program interface \(API\). A [Watcher](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/manage-watchers/what-is-a-watcher.md) monitors when a country is selected, and then another ProcessMaker Data Connector uses an Endpoint to get the list of states and/or provinces from that selected country based on that country's ISO code. The Watcher stores that list of states/provinces as a Request variable in that Request's data so that the second Select List control may access that list to display as its options. The second Select List control's options depend on the first Select List control's selection.

* **Tags:** [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md); [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md); [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control; dependent controls; dependent fields; API; application program interface; third-party API call; demo; video

## Use the ProcessMaker API and SDKs

This section contains videos how to use the [ProcessMaker RESTful Application Program Interface \(API\)](https://staging-pm4.processmaker.net/api/documentation) and ProcessMaker's Software Development Kits \(SDKs\). Every function that you may do in ProcessMaker's elegant and well-designed user interface makes an API call. Since every ProcessMaker function is supported in the ProcessMaker API, ProcessMaker can be [white-labeled](../processmaker-administration/user-interface-language-management/what-is-user-interface-language-management.md) to run behind the scenes from other SaaS applications. Learn how you can use the ProcessMaker API.
