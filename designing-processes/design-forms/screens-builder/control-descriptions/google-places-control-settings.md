# Google Places Control Settings

## Control Description

The Google Places control is a text field the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant uses to start entering an address, location, or business name. The Google Places control uses the Google API to auto-complete that address or location. The Google Place control stores the selected address in the Request data as well as all the returned data from the Google API.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

Below are a few ways to use the Google Places control:

* Allow Request participants to easily enter a shipping or billing address. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-address-example-package.png) 
* Enter a business name into the Google Places control to select a business location. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-business-example-package.png) 
* Enter well-known monuments or international airport names to get their addresses or locations when requesting to travel. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-airport-example-package.png) 

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To add a Google Places control to a [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md), the [Google Places package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/google-places-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Google Places control and the Google Places [package](../../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) are not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Google Places control can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [Create a new ProcessMaker Screen](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or click the **Edit** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png)to edit the selected Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Design mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Locate the **Google Places** icon ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-icon-screen-builder-package.png) in the panel to the left of the Screen Builder canvas.
4. Drag the **Google Places** icon into the Screen Builder canvas. Existing controls on the Screen Builder canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the Screen Builder canvas where you want the control to display on the ProcessMaker Screen. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-in-preview-mode-package.png) 
6. Configure the Google Places control. See [Settings](rich-text-control-settings.md#settings).
7. Validate that the control is configured correctly. See [Validate Your Screen](../validate-your-screen.md#validate-a-processmaker-screen).

{% endhint %}

After [adding a control to a ProcessMaker Screen page](google-places-control-settings.md#add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen), you may move it to another location on that page such that it is above or below other controls placed on that page. A control cannot be moved to another [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) page.

Follow these steps to move a control to another location on that ProcessMaker Screen page:

1. Place your cursor anywhere on the control not displaying the **Duplicate Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-duplicate-control-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)or **Delete Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)buttons.
2. Hold your cursor, then drag the control above or below other controls on that ProcessMaker Screen page. Screen Builder previews where the control would display on the page based on how you position the control above or below other controls. If the control cannot be placed in a location because your cursor is above an existing control or too far to the left or right of the page, the![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/movement-not-allowed-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)icon displays in the preview.
3. Place the control at the location on the page you want it. The other control\(s\) on the page automatically adjust position.

### Variable Panel Settings

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Variable** panel that is on the right-side of the Screen Builder canvas.

Below are settings for the Line Input control in the **Variable** panel:

* [Variable Name](google-places-control-settings.md#variable-name)
* [Label](google-places-control-settings.md#label)
* [Validation Rules](google-places-control-settings.md#validation-rules)

#### Variable Name

Edit the default **Variable Name** setting value for this control if necessary. The **Variable Name** setting value represents data in this control during [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). Ensure that the **Variable Name** setting value is a unique name from other controls in this [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) and contains at least one letter. This is a required setting.  
![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-variable-name-screen-builder-package-designer.png) 

Use the **Variable Name** setting value in the following ways:

* Reference this control by its **Variable Name** setting's value. The **Data Preview** panel in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) corresponds the Google Places control's textual content with that Google Places control's **Variable Name** value. In the example below, `GooglePlacesControl` is the **Variable Name** setting's value. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-preview-screens-builder-package-designer.png) 
* Reference this control's value in a different Screen Builder control. To do so, use [mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) and reference this control's **Variable Name** value in the target control. Example: `{{ GooglePlacesControl }}`. See [Reference Request Data from the Google Places Control in Other Controls](google-places-control-settings.md#reference-request-data-from-the-google-places-control-in-other-controls).
* Reference this value in [**Visibility Rule** setting expressions](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md).
