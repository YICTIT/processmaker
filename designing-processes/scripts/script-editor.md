# Script Editor

## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create or edit a [ProcessMaker Script](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script/@merged):

* Scripts: View Scripts
* Scripts: Create Scripts
* Scripts: Edit Scripts

See the ProcessMaker [Scripts](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups#scripts/@merged) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Use Script Editor to develop and test your [ProcessMaker Scripts](what-is-a-script.md). Any ProcessMaker Script can be used in any Process in your organization developed using [programming languages that Script Editor supports](what-is-a-script.md#supported-programming-languages).‌

ProcessMaker Scripts run securely and in isolation from within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers called ProcessMaker [Script Executors](../../processmaker-administration/script-executor-management/what-is-a-script-executor.md). When the ProcessMaker instance calls a ProcessMaker Script to run, the ProcessMaker Script Executor for that programming language creates a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) corresponding with that programming language, runs the Script, and then destroys the Docker container. This ensures that any malicious script that anyone in your organization might inadvertently introduce to ProcessMaker does not affect the ProcessMaker instance or its hosting environment: Docker containers cannot access them. Furthermore, Docker containers cannot listen for inbound connections; therefore, a Docker container cannot be accessed externally.

ProcessMaker Scripts are developed and tested in the same environment.

Access Script Editor in the following ways:

* ​[Create a new ProcessMaker Script.](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/designing-processes/scripts/manage-scripts/create-a-new-script#create-a-new-processmaker-script/@merged)​
* ​[Edit an existing ProcessMaker Script.](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/designing-processes/scripts/manage-scripts/edit-a-script#edit-a-processmaker-script/@merged)​

## Script Editor Usage Guidelines

‌Follow these guidelines to develop and test [ProcessMaker Scripts](what-is-a-script.md) in Script Editor.‌

### Develop Your ProcessMaker Script <a id="develop-your-processmaker-script"></a>

‌Develop the ProcessMaker Script below the script's name and language description. Use the scroll panel to navigate your code not currently displayed. This is useful especially when you are editing a long ProcessMaker Script.‌

### Mock Request Data Coming Into the ProcessMaker Script <a id="mock-request-data-coming-into-the-processmaker-script"></a>

‌Use the **Sample Input** panel to mock [Request data](../../json-the-foundation-of-request-data/what-is-request-data.md) that comes into the ProcessMaker Script.

Define the variables in a [ProcessMaker Screen](../design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) when you configure its controls. See [information about each control](../design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/).‌

Follow these guidelines to mock Request data coming into your ProcessMaker Script:‌

1. [​Open the ProcessMaker Screen](../design-forms/manage-forms/view-all-forms.md#view-all-scripts) in which to view its JSON data model.
2. Enter [Preview mode](../design-forms/screens-builder/screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) on the ProcessMaker Screen page to view its JSON data model. Click the **Preview** button from Screen Builder's top menu to enter Preview mode.
3. Enter values into the control settings as if you were using the ProcessMaker Screen in a Request. In the **Data Preview** panel, the JSON data model displays the key-value pairs in each object element. The keys' values are those you enter in the ProcessMaker Screen preview. Understand what the key names are. Each key is derived from a ProcessMaker Screen control's **Variable Name** setting value. Use these key names as variables in your ProcessMaker Script. The **Variable Name** setting values become part of the Request data and contain the content that Request participants enter into that ProcessMaker Screen during a Request. Mock these **Variable Name** setting values as input data to your ProcessMaker Script.
4. After you have entered values into the ProcessMaker Screen in Preview mode, the entire JSON data model displays in the **Data Preview** panel. Copy the JSON data model.
5. Paste the JSON data model into the **Sample Input** panel in Script Editor. If you use any variables as defined in the JSON data model in your ProcessMaker Script, Script Editor uses those variable values during script testing.
6. Optionally, mock the [ProcessMaker Magic Variables](../reference-global-variables-in-your-processmaker-assets.md) that your ProcessMaker Script would reference during an in-progress Request. ProcessMaker uses a set of Magic Variables that become part of the JSON data model for all Requests. ProcessMaker uses these Magic Variables to store ProcessMaker user, Process, and Request related data for all Requests. During an in-progress Request, these ProcessMaker Magic Variables are updated. All ProcessMaker Magic Variables are preceded by an underscore \(`_`\) character in the JSON data model. Enter the ProcessMaker Magic Variable into the **Sample Input** panel as part of the JSON data model, and then enter mock values for each. See [Magic Variable Descriptions](../reference-global-variables-in-your-processmaker-assets.md#magic-variable-descriptions).
7. Click **Run**.
8. In the **Output** panel, view the mocked Request data.

### ‌Enter Other JSON Data as Input to Your ProcessMaker Script

‌Use the **Configuration** panel to include JSON configuration settings your ProcessMaker Script uses when it runs. For example, include the Client ID and Client Secret values in JSON format for OAuth 2.0 verification to a third-party service's API your ProcessMaker Script must access to access the API. By entering these values into the **Configuration** panel, you can verify during testing that these values are valid for the third-party service.‌

A ProcessMaker Script may reference ProcessMaker Screen control values during a Request by placing their **Variable Name** setting values within [mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html). In the example below, `FullName` is the **Variable Name** setting value for a control to store a Request participant's full name:

```text
{
    "Name": "{{ FullName }}"
}
```

### ‌Test Your ProcessMaker Script

‌Click the **Run** button to test your ProcessMaker Script. Script Editor evaluates any JSON data entered into the **Configuration** and **Sample Input** panels.‌

If the ProcessMaker Script evaluates successfully, its output displays in the **Output** panel. If the ProcessMaker Script does not evaluate successfully, the language engine evaluating the script displays an error.‌

### Pass Request Data Into Your ProcessMaker Script <a id="pass-request-data-into-your-processmaker-script"></a>

‌Pass Request-related data into your ProcessMaker Script in the following ways:‌

* **Request data:** ProcessMaker uses a schema-less JSON data model from which to read, write, and store Request data. Since the JSON data model is schema-less, meaning that it does not require a specific schema or structure from which ProcessMaker assets must conform, the JSON data model is structured from the JSON objects in ProcessMaker assets used in a Request, such as the **Variable Name** setting values in a ProcessMaker Screen or variables a ProcessMaker Script creates. When an in-progress Request routes through the Process, Request data aggregates into the JSON data model, thereby becoming Request data. [ProcessMaker users](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) or [ProcessMaker group](../../processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group.md) members that have the [Requests: Edit Request Data permission](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) may view the JSON data model for a completed Request. This JSON data model displays from the [**Data** tab in a completed Request's summary](../../using-processmaker/requests/request-details/summary-for-completed-requests.md#editable-request-data). Below is an example. ProcessMaker Scripts can call Request data by referencing these JSON objects derived from **Variable Name** setting values in ProcessMaker Screens.

  ​![JSON data model in a Completed Request, as viewed from the &quot;Data&quot; tab](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LJ0aNaVW1m7sNsxVJLV%2F-LuEaghIGGk2o9s_BlcP%2F-LYT8B_rTB7I1mpsLBvg%2FData%20tab%20completed%20Request%20information%20-%20Requests.png?alt=media&token=ba495224-c057-4239-b729-482e6442732d)​

* **ProcessMaker Magic Variables:** ProcessMaker uses a set of Magic Variables that become part of the JSON data model for all Requests. ProcessMaker uses these Magic Variables to store ProcessMaker user, Process, and Request related data for all Requests. During an in-progress Request, these ProcessMaker Magic Variables are updated. All ProcessMaker Magic Variables are preceded by an underscore \(`_`\) character in the JSON data model. See [Reference Magic Variables in ProcessMaker Assets](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/designing-processes/reference-global-variables-in-your-processmaker-assets/@merged).
* **ProcessMaker Environment Variables:** The sensitive information that a [ProcessMaker Environment Variable](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/~/drafts/-M8lHWfe3NHeZQ-3bGbC/designing-processes/environment-variable-management/what-is-an-environment-variable/@merged) represents can pass to a ProcessMaker Script when it runs. Usage depends on the programming language that the ProcessMaker Script uses. In the usage examples below, `ENV_VAR_NAME` represents the name of the ProcessMaker Environment Variable. See [ProcessMaker Variable Syntax, Usage, and Examples](script-editor.md#processmaker-variable-syntax-usage-and-examples).

### ‌ProcessMaker Variable Syntax, Usage, and Examples

‌ProcessMaker uses two global variables that can ProcessMaker Scripts can call. Variable usage depends on the programming language that the ProcessMaker Script uses. See [ProcessMaker Variable Syntax, Usage, and Examples](script-editor.md#processmaker-variable-syntax-usage-and-examples). Below is a description of these global variables:‌

* **Data:** The `data` variable contains all Request data to the moment a ProcessMaker Script runs.
* **Config:** The `config` variable contains any special configuration to be passed to the ProcessMaker Script prior to it running.

‌Refer to the tabs below how to use ProcessMaker variables in supported programming languages.
