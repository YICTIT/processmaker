# View Environment Variables

## View All ProcessMaker Environment Variables <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker Environment Variables in one table that Process Owners throughout your organization have created. Any ProcessMaker Environment Variable can be used in any Process in your organization. Since ProcessMaker Environment Variables are abstract proxies to securely maintain sensitive information during in-progress [Requests](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md), Process Owners who create or use ProcessMaker Environment Variables in their Processes do not have access to that sensitive information. This makes it easy to manage sensitive information used in Requests.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Environment Variables: View Environment Variables" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Environment Variables unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the ProcessMaker [Environment Variable](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#environment-variables) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker Environment Variables in your organization:

1. ​[Log on](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/using-processmaker/log-in#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Designer** option from the top menu. The **Processes** page displays.

![Environment Variables page displays all Environment Variables in your organization](../../../.gitbook/assets/environment-variables-screen-processes.png)

The **Environment Variables** page displays the following information in tabular format about ProcessMaker Environment Variables:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the name of the ProcessMaker Environment Variable.
* **Description:** The **Description** column displays the description about the ProcessMaker Environment Variable.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Environment Variable was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Environment Variable was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The [Google Places package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/google-places-package.md) adds a [ProcessMaker Environment Variable](../what-is-an-environment-variable.md) called `GOOGLE_API_TOKEN` that contains the Google API token for that ProcessMaker instance. The ProcessMaker Environment Variable does not require configuration or revision after it has been added to your ProcessMaker instance. Please do not delete that ProcessMaker Environment Variable: all [Google Place controls](../../design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/google-places-control-settings.md) added to [Form](../../design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#form)-type [ProcessMaker Screens](../../design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) will no longer function it it is deleted.

The Google Places [package](../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Google Places package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
