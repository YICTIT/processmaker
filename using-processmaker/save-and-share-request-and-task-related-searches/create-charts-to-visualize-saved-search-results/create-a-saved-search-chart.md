# Create a Saved Search Chart

## Create a Horizontal Bar, Vertical Bar, Line, Pie, or Doughnut Chart

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To create a chart for a [Saved Search's](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) results, the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Follow These Steps for Specific Chart Types

Follow the steps below only to create a horizontal bar, vertical bar, line, pie, or doughnut chart types. Settings for the count and list chart types vary from the steps described below.

See the following sections for steps to create their chart types:

* [Create a Count Chart](create-a-saved-search-chart.md#create-a-count-chart)
* [Create a List Chart](create-a-saved-search-chart.md#create-a-list-chart)
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to create a horizontal bar, vertical bar, line, pie, or doughnut chart types for a Saved Search:

1. [View the search results for a Saved Search](../view-saved-searches-that-are-shared-with-you/view-search-results-for-a-saved-search.md) in which to create a chart. The **Data** tab displays the data details for that Saved Search.
2. Click the **Charts** tab. The **Charts** tab displays all charts created for this Saved Search.
3. Click the **+Chart** button. The **Create Chart** screen displays the **General** tab. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/general-tab-create-a-chart-saved-searches-package.png) 
4. In the **Name** setting, enter the name of the chart. This is a required setting.
5. From the **Chart Type** group, select one of the following chart types to visualize the results of this Saved Search:

   * **Bar \(Horizontal\):** The horizontal-style bar chart visualizes Saved Search results in horizontal bars. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#bar-chart-horizontal).
   * **Bar \(Vertical\):** The vertical-style bar chart visualizes Saved Search results in vertical bars. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#bar-chart-vertical).
   * **Line:** The line chart visualizes Saved Search results as data points on a line to show how those results trend. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#line-chart).
   * **Pie:** The pie chart visualizes Saved Search results as relational proportions between data. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#pie-chart).
   * **Doughnut:** The doughnut chart visualizes Saved Search results as relational proportions between data similarly to the pie chart type but with the inner portion removed. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#doughnut-chart).
   * **Count:** The count chart displays a single data metric on a canvas. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#count). If you select the **Count** chart option, see [Create a Count Chart](create-a-saved-search-chart.md#create-a-count-chart) for its specific settings.
   * **List:** The list chart displays chart data in tabular format. See [chart example](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#list-chart). If you select the **List** chart option, see [Create a List Chart](create-a-saved-search-chart.md#create-a-list-chart) for its specific settings.

   **Bar \(Horizontal\)** is the default chart type.

6. Click the **Source** tab to configure from which Saved Search's results to visualize in the chart. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/source-tab-create-chart-screen-saved-searches-package.png) 
7. From the **Series** setting, select how to group the chart data. The [series](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#series) groups the chart content by the units of measurement in the X-axis for applicable chart types. See [chart example that references the series grouping](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#example-chart). Options that display in the **Series** drop-down menu derive from the columns configured from the Saved Search tabular data as displayed from the **Data** tab of this Saved Search. The default configurable columns vary for each type of Saved Search. The **Recommended** indicator for Saved Search results represent dates, numbers, and/or unique text results and are recommended when configuring the chart series. This is a required setting for applicable charts.
8. From the **Category** setting, optionally select a secondary measurement by which to aggregate the chart series. See [chart example that references the category measurement](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#example-chart). The **Category** setting does not apply to count charts. Options and their recommendations that display in the **Category** setting are the same as those in the **Series** setting.
9. From the **Metric** setting, select the chart contents from the Saved Search tabular-formatted results to aggregate as well as how to aggregate that data. The **Metric** setting options are numerically-based Saved Search results such as **\#** that represents the ID for the Request, Task, or ProcessMaker Collection record associated with that Saved Search. See [chart example that references how that chart data is aggregated](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#example-chart).

   Select from the following options how to aggregate the selected chart metric:

   * **Average:** The average is the arithmetic mean calculated by adding a group of values, and then dividing by the count of those items.
   * **Count:** The chart visualizes the number of values of the metric you select.
   * **Minimum:** The chart visualizes the minimum value of the metric you select.
   * **Maximum:** The chart visualizes the maximum value of the metric you select.
   * **Median:** The median is the middle value of a group of values that is calculated by sorting each of the values of the metric you select, then visualizing the middle value.
   * **Sum:** The sum is the arithmetic addition of each value of the metric you select. This is the default option.

   This is a required setting.

10. In the **Query** setting, optionally enter a ProcessMaker Query Language \(PMQL\) query from which to further filter the Saved Search's results. See the following topics for information how to use PMQL for Requests, Tasks, and ProcessMaker Collections:
    * [PMQL Syntax for Requests](../../search-processmaker-data-using-pmql.md#pmql-syntax-for-requests)
    * [PMQL Syntax for Tasks](../../search-processmaker-data-using-pmql.md#pmql-syntax-for-tasks)
    * [PMQL Syntax for ProcessMaker Collections](../../search-processmaker-data-using-pmql.md#pmql-syntax-for-processmaker-collections)
11. Click the **Display** tab to configure the appearance and style of the Saved Search chart. ****![](../../../.gitbook/assets/display-tab-create-chart-screen-saved-searches-package.png) 
12. From the **Color Scheme** setting, select the color palette from which to display the chart.
13. Enable the **Stacked** toggle key to stack the chart's data markers: overlay the data markers one another in the x- and y-axis. See [this chart as an example of stacked data markers](overview-of-saved-search-charts.md#bar-chart-vertical).
14. From the **Legend** setting, select where to place the legend in respect to the chart from the following options:
    * **None:** The chart legend does not display.
    * **Top:** The legend displays above the chart. This is the default option.
    * **Bottom:** The legend displays below the chart.
    * **Left:** The legend displays to the left of the chart.
    * **Right:** The legend displays to the right of the chart.
15. Click **Save**. If a required setting does not contain a value or selection, the following message displays: **The given data was invalid.**. Otherwise, the chart and the following message display: **Successfully Created Chart**.
