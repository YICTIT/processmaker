# Get Notified of Save Search Result Changes

## Overview

Receive a [notification](../../notifications.md) each time search results change based on your [Saved Search](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) parameters. For example, suppose that you have a Saved Search for all in-progress [Requests](../../requests/what-is-a-request.md) for a particular [Process](../../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md), such as for a Purchase Request Process. Each time a Request starts for that Process, your Saved Search results change. If your Saved Search is configured to send notifications each time your Saved Search results change, you receive a notification.

Below are other examples to receive a notification when the Saved Search results change:

* If your Saved Search parameters include when a new [self-service Task](../../task-management/self-assign-tasks-to-yourself-from-a-queue.md) is available, receive a notification.
* If a record ID in a ProcessMaker Collection changes, receive a notification. Note that the [ProcessMaker Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance to use ProcessMaker Collections.

Saved Search notifications can be [enabled](get-notified-of-save-search-result-changes.md#enable-notification-of-saved-search-result-changes) or [disabled](get-notified-of-save-search-result-changes.md#disable-notification-of-saved-search-results) only for your own Saved Searches. Saved Searches by default send notifications when a Saved Search's results change.
